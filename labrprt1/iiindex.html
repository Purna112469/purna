    <p>HTML is the backbone of the internet.One of the fundamental aspects of HTML is its simplicity.. It uses a system of tags surrounded by angle brackets to define elements within a document. These tags tell the browser how to display the content enclosed within them.
        HTML is also highly versatile. While its primary purpose is to structure content, it can also embed media such as images, videos, and audio files.HTML is often used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the basis of modern web development. Together, these technologies enable developers to create dynamic, visually appealing, and interactive websites and web applications.
     <br>However, despite its simplicity, HTML has its limitations. It's primarily a static markup language, meaning that it lacks the ability to perform complex logic or data processing on its own. For dynamic functionality, developers typically rely on JavaScript or server-side languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. <br> Overall, HTML remains a foundational technology in web development, playing a crucial role in shaping the digital landscape we interact with daily. Its simplicity, versatility, and accessibility make it an indispensable tool for developers worldwide. </p>
